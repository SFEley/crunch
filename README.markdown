Crunch
======
Crunch is an alternative MongoDB driver with an emphasis on high concurrency, atomic update operations, and document integrity. It uses the Rev event library for non-blocking writes and reads. Its API is more limited than the official Mongo Ruby driver, but simpler and more Rubyish.

_(It's still being built.  Please don't try to install it yet.  You'll know when it's ready because this text won't be here.)_
